## 💬 Who Am I?

I’m that person who looks at a website and wonders, *“What if I could break this… but for a good reason?”* 😎  
Hi! I’m **FrostFoe** — cybersecurity nerd, ethical hacker, and the mind behind **thnbangladesh** (The Hacker News বাংলা).

I don’t just tinker with tech — I live in the world of it. I love figuring out how systems work, how they break, and most importantly — how to **make them stronger**. My goal? To help people feel safe in the online world, just like they should in the real one.

## 🧠 A Few Cool Things I Do  

- I build **tools** that help spot weaknesses in systems — before the bad guys do.  
- I’ve helped companies **test their defenses** with real-world cyberattack simulations.  
- My scripts aren’t just powerful — they look cool too.  
- I run **The Hacker News (বাংলা)**, where we spread awareness, drop security tips, and build a community that *actually cares* about internet safety.

## 📖 A Bit of My Story

Once upon a time (okay, not *that* long ago), I started sharing cybersecurity tips, tricks, and tools. It started small. But then **thnbangladesh** grew into something more — a **movement**. A place where people came to learn, protect, and share. 

But like any good story, ours had a few plot twists.

We hit some tough times — from banned channels to burnout. There were moments we thought it was all over. But then, something amazing happened: **you**. Your messages, support, and faith brought us back to life.

So, we’re back. Stronger. Smarter. Hungrier. And we’re just getting started.

## ✨ What I Believe In

I believe the internet should be safe for *everyone*.  
I believe in breaking systems **to fix them**.  
I believe in education, open knowledge, and community.  
And I believe that no challenge is too big when you’ve got passion (and Python).
